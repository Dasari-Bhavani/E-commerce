            <h1>Wall Clocks</h1>
            <p>A wall clock can add an element of beauty and elegance to any room in the home. Whether that means putting one up in the kitchen to match the decor or putting a focal point clock in the living room where guests can admire it, you’ll want the convenience of having a clock on the wall.</p>
            <p>The demands of modern living mean that time is more valuable than ever. Keep track of it with decorative wall clocks that not only help tell you the time but also bring a certain charm and magic to the walls of your home. The look that a wall clock brings is of graphic distinction, imparting a sense of significance and importance in any room adorned with unique wall clocks. You can hang one literally anywhere, from your kitchen, family room, bedroom, to transition areas, like hallways and stairwells. From contemporary wall clocks to vintage wall clocks, they are appropriate just about anywhere. LuxeDecor carries a vast array of different styles, shapes, colors, and materials that will invoke your personal sense of style and complement your home décor.</p>
            <p>While shopping for your wall clock, there are many things to consider. For instance, what kind of weight can your wall hold? What is your budget? And in what room or what position are you going to place the clock? These factors will help you to determine the best shape, style, and size of your wall clock.</p>
        
            <h2>Before You Buy</h2>
            <p><strong>Budget:</strong> Budget matters. It is easy to stick to a budget when you are buying something boring like groceries. However, when you purchase a beautiful wall clock that is meant to add an element of beauty and focal point to your room, it is more difficult to hold back on overspending. However, there's no need to overspend. There are thousands of brands, styles, and designs of clocks on the market, and many of them are budget-friendly. This means that you are sure to find something that you love which brings your home together beautifully.</p>
            <p><strong>Weight:</strong> Most clocks are fairly lightweight. Those made of metal framework or plastics are often the lightest. With these, it doesn't matter where you position them on the wall, and there is little risk of them falling. However, if you have a solid metal clock or one that is made of stone material like marble, then it is important to consider how much it weighs and whether there is a specific area of your wall where it needs to hang.</p>
            <p><strong>Position:</strong> The place to hang a clock in your home depends first and foremost on whether it is the focal point of your room. If so, it might look great centered over a fireplace, sofa, or TV. If your wall clock is more functional than decorative, consider placing it where it is easily spotted, above a door or entryway.</p>
        
            <h2>Features to Consider</h2>
            <p><strong>Shape:</strong> Fancy wall clocks come in all different shapes and sizes, with the most popular being a circular shape. However, if the decor in your room is centered around a specific item, like a sunflower, then you might choose to get a clock in the shape of one. Some people will find fun and decorative clocks to place in their kitchen on the wall. Those clocks could be in the shape of a large spoon, a frying pan, and so forth. Whatever shape you choose, know that there are countless options at your fingertips.</p>
            <p><strong>Sound:</strong> If you're looking for a fun, classic type of wall clock, consider getting one with a sound. Grandfather clocks are well known for their chimes on the hour, and cuckoo clocks are known for their cuckoo sounds. These sounds can add a nice touch to the cozy atmosphere of your home. Likewise, they bring back reminiscent memories and foster a sense of nostalgia.</p>
            <p><strong>Design:</strong> When you go to consider your wall clock, think about the design elements you are looking for. If your place is on the wall in your living room, think about what design features your living room has. For instance, does it have a more modern feel to it? If so, then getting a geometrically shaped wall clock or a modern art-looking clock might be the right choice. On the other hand, if you are going for a more vintage and cozy feel, then a classic metal or marble clock would be a nice focal point for the room.</p>
            <p><strong>Material:</strong> There are many materials that clocks for walls can be made of. These can include metal, wood, plastics, and even stone. The weight of each material varies, as does the appeal. If you choose a clock that is handmade, the artistry and manipulation work that goes into creating a beautiful piece of art that you can hang on your wall will be something you can show off to anyone who visits. Wood clocks are a classic and more vintage style. Traditionally, grandfather clocks and cuckoo clocks are made, in part, with wood found locally by the artisan. The clock that incorporates an element of metal typically has a metal frame rather than a solid metal facepiece. This makes these clocks a bit lighter than some others.</p>
